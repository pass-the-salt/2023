You will find on this page specific information for speakers (slides, rooms equipments, setup testing recommandation) and also, the speakers dinner and some not so trustable advices about hotels ;-) <br><br>

**IMPORTANT:** **all other practical information** (conference location, how to come, on-site registration, eat/drink/social event ...) are located on the [general practical info page](/practical/).<br><br>

# Speakers dinner

On Monday evening, we will have a lunch with all the speakers who have accepted to come and the org team.<br><br>

It will be held at: "Las Tapas" restaurant - 116 Rue Saint-André, 59000 Lille<br><br>

Maps : https://goo.gl/maps/K8A9W8556sAmgSe66 <br><br>

**IMPORTANT** as shown on the map, it is at a **22min walk from the Lille Flandres train station**. And no public transportation to reach it. 
So, if for any of you, **for any reason**, it is a problem to walk this duration, just raise your hand! We will book a Uber or Taxi for you, no problem for that!<br><br>

It will start **at 8:00PM / 20h00**.<br><br>

The dinner will be paid by the event, with a package for the drinks.<br><br>

# Hotels

It is not an easy task to give you a trustable advice for your hotel. All we can do is to share with you the hotels we have used by the past. They all provide nights between 100€ and 140€.<br><br>

No air conditionning, less expensive:<br>

[Grand Hotel](https://www.grandhotellille.com/)<br>
[Ambassadeur Hotel](https://www.hotel-lille-ambassadeur.fr/)<br><br>

More expensive, with AC:<br>

[Okko Hotel](https://www.okkohotels.com/en/page/lille/.3097.html)<br>
[La Valiz Hotel](https://www.hotellavaliz.com/)<br><br>

The best advice we can share is for <b>the location of the hotel</b>: <b>try to stay around the Bruxelles or Flandres stations area</b>. This way you will be near the center of Lille and also near the "Lille Flandres" metro station (under the "Lille Flandres" trains station) you will use to reach the conference location.<br><br>

**Important:** other practical information (location, how to come, eat/drink etc) are available on the [dedicated practical info page](/practical/) !<br><br>

# Talks & slides

**Test your video setup BEFORE your talk:** please come during the pause (or before the start of the morning / afternoon session) on stage in order to test your laptop with the video system.
<br><br>

**Duration:** there are long (35min) and short (20min) talks. Each given duration includes the Q&A time. We use to dedicate 5min to Q&A but it remains your choice. If the 5min does not fit you, just give us your preference before the talk and we will announce it to the audience.
<br><br>

**Speaker deck template and format:** Pass the SALT does not provide nor require any kind of template. We prefer to receive PDF files. You can also provide LibreOffice format if you preferred. Powerpoint, anyone? You are at Pass the SALT, please ;-)
<br><br>

**Code of Conduct:** Pass the SALT has a [code of conduct](https://2023.pass-the-salt.org/code-of-conduct/) for attendees and for speakers too, obviously. Your words and your slides will have to follow it without exception. Thanks in advance!
<br><br>

**Logo:** you can use our logo on your speaker deck. The correct source for it is in this [repository]( https://github.com/pass-the-salt/2023-communication/tree/main/logo/). 
<br><br>

**IMPORTANT send us your speaker deck:** we will greatly appreciate if you can provide your slides before your talk or just after it. We try to provide them to all attendees (on-site and online ones) as soon as possible on our [archives site](https://archives.pass-the-salt.org/Pass%20the%20SALT/).
<br><br>

# Lecture hall

**Main screen and projector:** the two are very recent ones and the screen is bigger than the previous one, for those who were there in 2018-2019 :)

**Plugs:** on stage, you will have HDMI and VGA plugs for video signal and some electrical plugs.
<br><br>

**Feedback screens:** you will have one feedback screen at the back of the hall (use big size fonts!) but also two others screens right in front of you, on a table before the first row of attendees.
<br><br>

**Recording:** your talk will be live streamed and recorded by our Ubicast friends. The video will then be uploaded to our [Ubicast Pass the SALT portal](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/) and also on our [archives site](https://archives.pass-the-salt.org/Pass%20the%20SALT/).
<br><br>

# Workshop room

**screen and projector:** you will have a very recent screen and projector.
<br><br>

**network access:** every participant who has accepted it during registration process will received a network access (we work to get non filtered SSH output among other things). We will try to set up an ethernet switch with less filtered as possible Internet access.
