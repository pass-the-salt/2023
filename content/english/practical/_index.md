# Safety & COVID information

At time of writing (May, 01 2023), there is no longer mandatory measures for handling COVID outbreak in public and open space or inside buildings aswell. Pass the SALT rooms will so be freely accessible without any mask for example.
<br><br>

Despite that situation, we will provide **free masks** and **hydroalcoholic gel** at the org desk and in the 2 rooms (lecture hall and workshops room). 
<br><br>

**Rooms equipments** :<br>
.&nbsp;**lecture hall**:  there is a ventilation system that is automatically activated when the temperature rises or when the CO2 reaches a certain level. In addition, polytech has several portable CO2 detectors and one will be placed prominently on the desk at the bottom of the lecture hall.
<br>
.&nbsp;**workshop room**: there is air-conditioning, there will also be a portable CO2 detector in place. 

<br>

**Pauses:** they will take place at the back entrance of the building, but outside, to be in an open space and not in a room. Obviously, if the weather is not on our side, the pause will be held inside the building with opened doors.
<br><br>

**Social event:** we will be have an access to a terrace. So, we will be able to get fresh air and not to stay inside the building during all the evening.
